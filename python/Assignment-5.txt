1. What does an empty dictionary's code look like?
	
	d= dict()


2. What is the value of a dictionary value with the key foo and the value 42?
	
	d= dict()
	d[foo] = 42
	print(d) #{foo:42}
	

3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?
	
	d = dict() or {} 
	it has flower brackets,and key are immutable and values are mutable
	l = [] 
	it has square brackets,and it is mutable.
	

4. What happens if you try to access spam[foo] if spam is {bar: 100}?
	spam {bar : 100}
	print(spam[foo]) #it raise the name error	

5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions cat in spam and
cat in spam.keys()?
	
	spam = {'bar': 100, 'cat': 200}
	result = 'cat' in spam #True
		and
	result = 'cat' in spam.keys() #True
	cat in spam is generally faster than cat in spam.keys() because the former directly checks the dictionary for the key, while the latter involves 	creating a keys view object.
	And result was same.


6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions cat in spam and
cat in spam.values()?
	cat in spam: Checks if 'cat' is a key in the dictionary.
	cat in spam.values(): Checks if 'cat' is a value in the dictionary.


7. What is a shortcut for the following code?
if color not in spam:
spam[color] = black;
	
	spam.setdefault(color, 'black')



8. How do you "pretty print" dictionary values using which module and function?

	from pprint import pprint

	# Example dictionary
	spam = {'name': 'Praveen', 'age': 23, 'job': 'Engineer', 'languages': ['Python', 'JavaScript'], 'address': {'city': 'Chicago', 'zip': '60194'}}

	# Pretty printing the dictionary
	pprint(spam)

	
	{'address': {'city': 'Chicago', 'zip': '60194'},
	 'age': 23,
 	'job': 'Engineer',
 	'languages': ['Python', 'JavaScript'],
 	'name': 'Praveen'}
