1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

*    ---- (multiplication)mathematical expression 

'hello'  ------- string value

-87.8  ------ float value

-  --- (subtraction)mathematical expression

/  ---- (division)mathematical expression

+  ----- (addition)mathematical expression

6  ----- integer value
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

string - string is fundamental datatype,it is immutable.
ex:-
	"hello","python"
variable - variable is name to store the data,can hold different datatypes.
ex:-
	name = 'praveen'
	age = 18

3. Describe three different data types.
	
	list - [],mutable,growable nature,insertion order preserved,allows duplicates
	ex:- my_list = [1, "hello", 3.5, True]
	tuple - (),immutable,insertion order preserved,Fixed Size,allows duplicates
	ex:- my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.5, True)
	set - {},mutable,insertion not preserved,Unique Elements,does not allows duplicates
	ex:- my_set = {1, 2, 3, "hello"}

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
		
	- An expression in programming is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a new value.
	- All expressions are evaluated to produce a result or value.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

	- An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a value.
	- A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. It represents an action or command, such as creating a variable, displaying 	  output, or controlling the flow of execution.


6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

	bacon = 22
	print(bacon + 1)
	bacon = 23

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
	'spam' + 'spamspam'  ---> print('spam' + 'spamspam') == spamspamspam
	spam * 3     	     ---> print('spam' * 3) == spamspamspam
 

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

		In Python (and most programming languages), variable names must follow specific rules for them to be considered valid. Let's look at why 		eggs is a valid variable name while 100 is not.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

The three functions in Python that can be used to convert a value to an integer, floating-point number, or string are:

	int(): Converts to integer.
	float(): Converts to floating-point number.
	str(): Converts to string.


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

	print('I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos')
	TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
	The expression print('I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos') causes an error because it attempts to concatenate a string ('I have eaten') with an integer (99)

	print('I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos')
	The str(99) converts the integer 99 into a string, allowing it to be concatenated with the other strings without causing a type error.
