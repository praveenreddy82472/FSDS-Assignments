Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?

To support iteration in your classes, you can implement the following two operator overloading methods:

__iter__: This method is called when an iterator is required for a container. It should return an iterator object (typically, self or a new iterator instance).

__next__: This method returns the next value from the iterator. It should raise a StopIteration exception when there are no more values to return.


Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?

The two operator overloading methods that manage printing are:

__str__: This method is called by the built-in print() function and the str() constructor. It should return a human-readable string representation of the object, suitable for display.

__repr__: This method is called by the built-in repr() function and is intended for developers. It should return a string that ideally could be used to recreate the object, providing an unambiguous representation.

Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?

class MyClass:
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # Handle slice
            return "Handling slice"
        else:
            # Handle single item
            return "Handling single item"


Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iadd__(self, other):
        self.value += other
        return self  # Return self to support chaining


Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?

Operator overloading is appropriate when:

Intuitive Interfaces: You want to provide a more intuitive interface for your classes, making them easier to use and understand (e.g., implementing addition for a Vector class).

Custom Data Types: You're creating custom data types that need to behave like built-in types (e.g., supporting arithmetic operations, comparisons, or indexing).

Enhancing Readability: You aim to enhance the readability of your code, allowing users to perform operations using natural syntax rather than calling methods explicitly.

Domain-Specific Logic: Your class represents a domain-specific concept where operator overloading would make operations more natural (e.g., for mathematical computations or complex data structures).

However, operator overloading should be used judiciously, as overusing it or making operations non-intuitive can lead to confusion and maintainability issues.
