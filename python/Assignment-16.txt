1. Create a list called years_list, starting with the year of your birth, and each year thereafter until
the year of your fifth birthday. For example, if you were born in 1980. the list would be years_list =
[1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985].

# Define the year of birth
birth_year = 2001

# Create a list of years from birth_year to the year of the fifth birthday (inclusive)
years_list = list(range(birth_year, birth_year + 6))

# Print the result
print(years_list) #year_list = [2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006]


2. In which year in years_list was your third birthday? Remember, you were 0 years of age for your
first year.

# Determine the year of the third birthday
third_birthday_year = years_list[3]

# Print the result
print(third_birthday_year) #2003


3.In the years list, which year were you the oldest?

# Determine the year in which you were the oldest (the last year in the list)
oldest_year = years_list[-1]

# Print the result
print(oldest_year)#2006
4. Make a list called things with these three strings as elements: 'mozzarella', 'cinderella',
'salmonella'.

list= ['mozzarella','cinderella','salmonella']


5. Capitalize the element in things that refers to a person and then print the list. Did it change the
element in the list?

things= ['mozzarella','cinderella','salmonella']

# Find the index of the element that refers to a person
person_index = things.index("cinderella")

# Capitalize the element at that index
things[person_index] = things[person_index].capitalize()

# Print the list
print(things)

6. Make a surprise list with the elements 'Groucho','Chico', and 'Harpo'.

suprise_list  = ['Groucho','Chico','Harpo']

7. Lowercase the last element of the surprise list, reverse it, and then capitalize it.


suprise_list  = ['Groucho','Chico','Harpo']

lo = suprise_list[-1].lower()

print(lo)

re = suprise_list[-1][::-1]
print(re)

ca = suprise_list[-1][::-1].capitalize()

suprise_list[-1]  =ca

print(suprise_list) #['Groucho', 'Chico', 'Oprah']

8. Make an English-to-French dictionary called e2f and print it. Here are your starter words: dog is
chien, cat is chat, and walrus is morse.

# Create the English-to-French dictionary
e2f = {
    'dog': 'chien',
    'cat': 'chat',
    'walrus': 'morse'
}

# Print the dictionary
print(e2f)


9. Write the French word for walrus in your three-word dictionary e2f.

print(e2f['walrus'])


10. Make a French-to-English dictionary called f2e from e2f. Use the items method.
# Create the English-to-French dictionary
e2f = {
    'dog': 'chien',
    'cat': 'chat',
    'walrus': 'morse'
}

# Create the French-to-English dictionary from e2f
f2e = {french: english for english, french in e2f.items()}

# Print the French-to-English dictionary
print(f2e)


11. Print the English version of the French word chien using f2e.

print(f2e[chien])  #dog


12. Make and print a set of English words from the keys in e2f.

english_words_set = set(e2f.keys())

# Print the set of English words
print(english_words_set)

13. Make a multilevel dictionary called life. Use these strings for the topmost keys: 'animals','plants',
and 'other'. Make the 'animals' key refer to another dictionary with the keys 'cats','octopi', and
'emus'. Make the "cats" key refer to a list of strings with the values "Henri","Grumpy", and "Lucy".
Make all the other keys refer to empty dictionaries.

# Create the multilevel dictionary
life = {
    'animals': {
        'cats': ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'],
        'octopi': {},
        'emus': {}
    },
    'plants': {},
    'other': {}
}

# Print the multilevel dictionary
print(life)



14. Print the top-level keys of life.

print(list(life.keys()))

15. Print the keys for life[animals].

print(life['animals'].keys())

16. Print the values for life[animals][cats]

print(life['animals']['cats'])
