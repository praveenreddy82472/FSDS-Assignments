1.How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the
number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).
sol. 60

Seconds in an hour=Seconds in a minute × Minutes in an hour 
Seconds in an hour=60×60=3600

2. Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called
seconds_per_hour.

# Number of seconds in a minute
seconds_per_minute = 60

# Number of minutes in an hour
minutes_per_hour = 60

# Calculate the number of seconds in an hour and assign it to a variable
seconds_per_hour = seconds_per_minute * minutes_per_hour

# Print the result
print(seconds_per_hour)  #3600

3. How many seconds do you think there are in a day? Make use of the variables seconds per hour
and minutes per hour.

# Number of seconds in a minute
seconds_per_minute = 60

# Number of minutes in an hour
minutes_per_hour = 60

# Calculate the number of seconds in an hour
seconds_per_hour = seconds_per_minute * minutes_per_hour

# Number of hours in a day
hours_per_day = 24

# Calculate the number of seconds in a day
seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour * hours_per_day

# Print the result
print(seconds_per_day)  #86400



4. Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day

# Number of seconds in a minute
seconds_per_minute = 60

# Number of minutes in an hour
minutes_per_hour = 60

# Calculate the number of seconds in an hour
seconds_per_hour = seconds_per_minute * minutes_per_hour

# Number of hours in a day
hours_per_day = 24

# Calculate the number of seconds in a day and assign it to a variable
seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour * hours_per_day

# Print the result
print(seconds_per_day)


5. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.

hours_in_a_day = seconds_per_day / seconds_per_hour

# Print the result
print(hours_in_a_day)   #24.0


6. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree
with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?

hours_in_a_day = seconds_per_day // seconds_per_hour

# Print the result
print(hours_in_a_day)   #24

7. Write a generator, genPrimes, that returns the sequence of prime numbers on successive calls to
its next() method: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...


def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def genPrimes():
    """Generate an infinite sequence of prime numbers."""
    num = 2  # Start from the first prime number
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            yield num
        num += 1

# Example usage:
prime_gen = genPrimes()
for _ in range(10):  # Print the first 10 primes
    print(next(prime_gen))
