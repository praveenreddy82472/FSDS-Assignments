Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and
7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
100
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,35,70


def gen(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 5 == 0 and i % 7 == 0:
            yield i

# Using list comprehension to generate and print the numbers in a comma-separated form
result = ','.join(str(num) for num in gen(100))
print(result)





Question 2:
Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma
separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
10
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,2,4,6,8,10


def gen(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i

# Using list comprehension to generate and print the numbers in a comma-separated form
result = ','.join(str(num) for num in gen(10))
print(result)


Question 3:
The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence in comma
separated form with a given n input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
7

Then, the output of the program should be:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13


def fibonacci(n):
    fib_seq = [0, 1]  # Initializing the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
    [fib_seq.append(fib_seq[i-1] + fib_seq[i-2]) for i in range(2, n + 1)]
    return fib_seq

# Input from the user
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Using list comprehension to generate the Fibonacci sequence
result = ','.join(str(num) for num in fibonacci(n))
print(result)



Question 4:
Assuming that we have some email addresses in the 'username@companyname.com' format,
please write program to print the user name of a given email address. Both user names and
company names are composed of letters only.
Example:
If the following email address is given as input to the program:
john@google.com
Then, the output of the program should be:
john


import re
str = 'john@google.com'

# Regular expression to capture the part before the '@'
username = re.match(r'([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@',str).group(1)

# Print the username
print(username)




Question 5:
Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function
which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area
of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.


class Shape:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def area(self):
        return 0

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length):
        super().__init__()
        self.length = length

    def area(self):
        return self.length ** 2

# Example usage
shape = Shape()
print(f"Area of shape: {shape.area()}")  # Output will be 0

square = Square(5)
print(f"Area of square: {square.area()}")  # Output will be 25
