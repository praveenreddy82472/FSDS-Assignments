1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?

	Use shutil.copy() to copy individual files.
	Use shutil.copytree() to copy entire directories, including all files and subdirectories.

2. What function is used to rename files??
	
	import os
	os.rename(): Used to rename files or directories.

3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?

	Use send2trash if you want to provide a way to recover files or directories after deletion.
	Use os.remove() or shutil.rmtree() if you need to permanently delete files or directories without recovery options.

4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?

	The ZipFile() constructor is used to open a ZIP file, similar to how the open() function is used to open a regular file.
	After opening a ZIP file with ZipFile(), you can use its methods to interact with the contents of the ZIP archive.
	
5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.



import os
import shutil

def copy_files_with_extension(src_folder, dest_folder, extension):
    """
    Searches for files with a certain extension in the src_folder and copies them to dest_folder.

    :param src_folder: The source directory to search in.
    :param dest_folder: The destination directory to copy files to.
    :param extension: The file extension to search for (e.g., '.pdf', '.jpg').
    """
    if not os.path.exists(dest_folder):
        os.makedirs(dest_folder)  # Create the destination directory if it doesn't exist

    # Walk through the directory tree
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(src_folder):
        for file in files:
            if file.lower().endswith(extension):
                src_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                dest_path = os.path.join(dest_folder, file)
                shutil.copy(src_path, dest_path)
                print(f"Copied {src_path} to {dest_path}")

# Example usage
source_folder = 'path/to/source_folder'
destination_folder = 'path/to/destination_folder'
file_extension = '.pdf'  # Change to the desired file extension

copy_files_with_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, file_extension)
